## How to use

It's simple! Just hit the pinball plunger in the top right that says "randomize." Once you do, you'll get a completely new effect to play around with!

### Drywet

Turn the dry-wet knob to change the level of the effects, not including the intensity knob.

### Intensity

The intensity knob controls a low end saturator. Change it to dramatically change the tone of the sound.

### Power Button

The power button in the top left will simply bypass the effects, including the intensity knob.

## Presets

luck.machine features 2 savable preset slots, which you can access from the middle red coin slots. 
<br><br>
If not glowing red, you can click it to save the current effects to be recalled later from other sessions or DAWs.
<br><br>
Each preset has a clear button next to it to delete the current save slot.
